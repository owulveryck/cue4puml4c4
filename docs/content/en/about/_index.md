{{< blocks/cover title="About this website" image_anchor="top" height="full" color="blue" >}}
This website is a work-in-progress. Its goal is to help the user use the library.
The layout of the website follows the [divio documentation system](https://documentation.divio.com/). You will find four sections:

## Tutorials

> Tutorials are lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series of steps to complete a project of some kind. They are what your project needs in order to show a beginner that they can achieve something with it.

## How-to guides

> How-to guides take the reader through the steps required to solve a real-world problem.

## Reference

> Reference guides are technical descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it.

## Explanation

> Explanation, or discussions, clarify and illuminate a particular topic. They broaden the documentationâ€™s coverage of a topic.
